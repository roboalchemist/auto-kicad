"""Turn a finished schematic into a netlisted board. See DESIGN.md, "Phases".

The schematic phase ends when the board phase begins: every symbol with a footprint becomes a
placed footprint on a new board, and the nets the schematic names become pad nets. Layout then
starts from a board that is already electrically correct, which is the whole point of drawing
the schematic first.

Footprints are placed on a grid roughly in schematic order, so the layout starts tidy rather
than overlapping at the origin. The agent moves them from there.
